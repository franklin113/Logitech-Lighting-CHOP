# Logitech-Lighting-CHOP
A C++ Chop For Controlling Logitech's Light Sync Enabled Devices 

I've only tested it with the G560 speakers, and it works well. On other devices you may run into issues while trying to change the color of different zone's lighting. Raise an issue if you need support for another device.


version 1.0 - 
- The chop has two pages, one for settings a solid color for all zones, and another for settings the color for seperate zones.
- On the "All Zones" page there is a toggle button that enables or disables "All Zones" control. 
- Issues-
    - Device Dropdown doesn't do anything
    - You need to manually set the number of zones
